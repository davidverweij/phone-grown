# Phone-Grown
Phone Grown is an open-source, DIY tutorial that helps families transform an unused smartphone into an ambient information display. It is built on a Google Sheet template, which acts as the database and user interface. With the database 'exposed', families can configure rules and design visual outputs for your phone to respond with any incoming data. Using pen and paper, they can contextualise these visual outputs further to suit your needs.
